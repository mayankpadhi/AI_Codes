# Problem Statement
## Problem 1
Write a program to randomly generate k-SAT problems. The program must accept values for k, m- the number clauses in the formula and n- the number of variables. Each clause of length k must contain distinct variables or their negation. Instances generated by this algorithm belong to fixed clause length model of SAT and are known as Uniform Random k-SAT problem.

## Problem 2
Write a program to solve Uniform Random 3-SAT problem for different combinations of m and n and compare their performance. Try
* Hill-Climbing
* Best-First Search
* Variable Neighbourhood(Search) Descent with 3 neighbour functions
