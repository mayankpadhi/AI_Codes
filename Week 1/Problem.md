# Problem Statement:
## Problem 1:
Objective is to use the given six numbers to arithmetically calculate a random chosen number.  Only the four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division may be used, and no fraction may be introduced into the calculation.  Each number may be used at most once.

The initial six numbers should be taken as input from the user.  The target number should be generated randomly from 100 to 999.  
If the exact expression is not found, the program should print out the expression that evaluates to a value that is the closest to the target value.
