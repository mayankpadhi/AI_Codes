# Problem Statement
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a hard problem, and is simple to state.  Given a  graph in which the nodes are locations of cities, and edges are labelled with the cost of travelling between cities,  find a cycle containing each city exactly once, such that the total cost of the tour is as low as possible.

For the state of Gujarat, find out at least twenty important tourist locations.  Suppose your relatives are about to visit you next week.  Use GA to plan a cost effective tour of Gujarat.  It is reasonable to assume that the cost of travelling between two locations is proportional to the distance between them.
