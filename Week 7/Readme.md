# Problem Statements

## Problem 1
Construct an ANN with one layer of hidden layer neural network and approximate the function of a given set of points.

## Problem 2
Damage the 50(20%) neurons in the network and flip 5 points in the pattern and check if the pattern is reconstructed. Increase the number of the patterns stored and tune the number of the number of damaged neurons and observe the relation between them.
