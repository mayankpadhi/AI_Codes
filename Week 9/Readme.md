Identify appropriate time needed to wash the load, given the dirtiness and volume of the load.

                          Load Dirtiness
                        V.Dirty        M.Dirty         L.Dirty       Not Dirty
          FullLoad       VLongTime	  VLongTime      LongTime         LittleTime
          MedLoad      VLongTime	  MedTime         MedTime         LittleTime
          LowLoad      LongTime	  LongTime        LittleTime      LittleTime
	

The rule table consists of 12 rules.  For example, the entry in the second row and the third column of the table specifies the rule:

If    load volume     is    medium load
And    load dirtiness    is    lightly dirty
Then    washing time    is    medium time


* Name and explain the four steps of fuzzy inference based on the Mamdani method.
* Convert the linguistic variables in the form of fuzzy sets.  Clearly state the formulation of each fuzzy set with their membership functions.
* Create your own fuzzy-logic based system for the above problem.
* Calculate various centers of gravity for different crisp values of input.
