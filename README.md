# Interesting AI Codes
Some interesting artificial intelligence implementations developed by me during AI labs in my institute. This will be updated throughout the semester. The detailed problems are stated in their respective directories.
* Week 1: State Space Search Problems
* Week 2: Hill-Climbing and Variable Neighbourhood search descent: Solving K-SAT problems
* Week 3: Genetic Algorithm Problem: Travelling Salesman
* Week 4: Path Finding: A* on Visibility Graph
* Week 5: Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Sudoku Solver
* Week 6: K-means clustering using MLE
* Week 7: Neural Network(Artificial Neural Network and Hopfield Networks)
* Week 8: Decision Tree Problem 
* Week 9: Fuzzy Logic Washing Machine <br/>

Final Project: Implementing the SOKOBAN Solver.
